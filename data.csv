JOUR ,,,,,"A study was conducted to assess the obstetric care coverage provided by the Sudanese village midwives. Mothers and village midwives, from four villages were interviewed using structured questionnaires. A total of 130 mothers who had delivered within 6 months were included in the study. Seventy per cent of these mothers contacted the village midwives at least once during their pregnancy. The average attendance was 3.8 antenatal contacts per mother. Seventy-one per cent of those who contacted the village midwives did so during the first half of pregnancy. Half of these mothers were seen in the village midwife's own home and only 20 per cent were in the mothers' homes. The village midwife attended 76 per cent of the deliveries, 11 per cent were attended by the traditional birth attendants, and the remainder delivered in hospital. The village midwives demonstrated reasonable standard of knowledge and competence in various aspects of antenatal care, history taking, examination, and selection of cases for referral. They lack adequate support and supervision, and supplies of drugs such as iron, folic acid, and chloroquine tablets. ",,,"Altigani, M.

JOUR ,,,,,"OBJECTIVE: Malaria is a common disease in many tropical and subtropical areas, which may threaten life. In this study, we examined the epidemiology of malaria in Bursa province using the data provided by the Province Health Directorate, collected over 2009 to 2012. METHODS: The data include a total of 29.683 blood samples taken by active and passive surveillance. Giemsa-stained thin and thick blood smears were examined with a 100X oil immersion objective using a standard microscope. RESULTS: A total of 21 (0.07%) malaria cases were detected. Of these, 20 (95.2%) cases were male and 1 (4.8%) case was female, with highest rates occurring in June and September. All of the cases were imported, of whom 10 (47.6%) were caused by Plasmodium vivax and 11 (52.4%) by P. falciparum. All P. falciparum cases were found to be imported cases that traveled to African nations (Cote d'Ivoire, Sudan, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Somalia). Malaria cases were mainly observed in the 15-to-44-year-old range. CONCLUSION: We believe that these results will lead to better-targeted and more effective malaria control programs. ",,,"Goral, G.

In this study, malaria cases detected and reported by the Malaria Control Dispensary of the Infectious Disease Division of Bursa Health Directory from October 2006 through December 2008 have been reported. The cases were evaluated according to age, gender, occupation and localization of the cases (indigenous or imported cases). A total of 23.416 blood smears were examined during this 26-month period and malaria parasite was found in 9 cases (0.038%). Of the 9 positive cases, 8 (88.9%) were male and 1 (11.1%) was female. Of these, 4 (44.5%) were acquired in Azarbajcan; 1 (1.1%) in Pakistan; 1 (1.1%) in Ghana; 1 (1.1%) in Sudan; 1 (1.1%) in an unknown Africa country; and 1 (1.1%) in the southeastern of Turkey. Except for three cases of foreign origin infected with Plasmodium falciparum, all the other cases were caused by Plasmodium vivax. The 0.05% decrease in malaria cases during the last 26-month, compared with prior data of malaria prevalence in Bursa, resulted primarily from a decrease in the number of cases acquired in Turkey.

JOUR ,,,,,"As of 30 June 2006, more than 3.5 million Colombians are internally displaced persons (IDPs), the second largest IDP population in the world after that of Sudan. While most IDP studies treat the plight of internally displaced women (IDW) as an isolated phenomenon, this paper demonstrates that their situation reflects Colombia's chronic cultural, political and socio-economic crisis. This paper uses a sexual and reproductive rights framework to establish a connection between IDW and Colombia's culture of violence, discrimination and inequality. The effects of this culture of violence, discrimination and inequality are highlighted during a discussion of the rights to health, reproduction, privacy, physical integrity, education, and freedom from violence and sexual exploitation. This paper argues that a holistic understanding of Colombia's humanitarian emergency is essential to improving the lives of IDPs. It ends with some concrete, short-term recommendations to meet some of the needs of IDPs and other vulnerable populations. ",,,"Alzate, M. M.

JOUR ,,,,,"BACKGROUND: The use of pediatric CT that had recently emerged as a valuable imaging tool has increased rapidly with an annual growth estimated at about 10% per year. Worldwide, there is a remarkable increase in the number of CT examinations performed. The purposes of this study are to: (i) to measure the radiation dose and estimate the effective doses to pediatric patients during CT for chest, abdomen and brain. MATERIAL/METHODS: A total of 182 patients were investigated. CT scanners that participated in this study are helical CT scanners (64 slices, 16 slices and dual slices). Organ and surface dose to specific radiosensitive organs were estimated by using software from National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB). RESULTS: For all patients, the age was ranged between 1.12 month-10.0 years while the weight was ranged between 5.0 kg to 29.0 kg. The DLP was 320.58 mGy.cm, 79.93 mGy.cm, 66.63 mGy.cm for brain, abdomen and chest respectively. The effective dose was, 2.05, 1.8, 1.08 mSv for brain, abdomen and chest respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The patient dose is independent of CT modality and depends on operator experience and CT protocol. The study has shown a great need for referring criteria, continuous training of staff in radiation protection concepts. Further studies are required in order to establish a reference level in Sudan.

JOUR ,,,,,"PURPOSE: This study evaluates using ultrasound the changes that occur in wall thickness, blood flow velocity, and Doppler indices of the common carotid arteries (CCAs) in healthy Saudi adult males who are current smokers. METHODS: A prospective study was performed between May 2011 and May 2013 with a group consisting of nonsmokers (n = 180; 36 %) and current smokers (n = 320; 64 %) with a mean age of 25 +/- 2.6 years. In all cases, the CCA ultrasound scanning protocol met the standards established by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) to measure intima media thickness (IMT), peak systolic velocity (PSV), and end diastolic velocity (EDV). The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze the results. RESULTS: Significant linear and positive correlations were noted between the level of daily consumption of cigarettes smoked and carotid mean IMT, PSV, and Doppler indices, while a linear and negative correlation was present between cigarette smoking and mean EDV. These findings were significant when compared with the results for nonsmokers. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is associated with CCA morphological changes caused by significant impairment of arterial endothelial function, and an increase in daily cigarette consumption significantly leads to a decrease in the blood flow velocity of CCAs.

JOUR ,,,,,"OBJECTIVE: To test the applicability of the Tanaka and Johnston equation for prediction of the mesiodistal width of unerupted permanent teeth in a Sudanese population and to develop a new prediction equation for this specific population if necessary. DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: School-based study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and fifty subjects (118 males and 132 females) age 13 - 19 years were randomly selected from two public secondary high schools in Khartoum State. Mesiodistal widths of the upper and lower permanent canines, first and second premolars (CPM) as well as the mandibular permanent incisors (MPI) were measured manually on the dental casts using a digital caliper. The predicted values of the mesiodistal widths were statistically compared with the respective actual sum of the canine and premolars of the same quadrant. RESULTS: Moderate correlation coefficients were found between the sum of the mesiodistal width of the MPI and the sum of the CPM in males (0.618 for mandibular arch and 0.626 for maxillary arch) and females (0.726 for mandibular arch and 0.680 for maxillary arch). A low coefficient of determination was recorded (0.45 and 0.48) in both jaws for combined genders. CONCLUSIONS: The Tanaka and Johnston equations overestimated the actual mesiodistal width of CPM in both arches for males and females. New prediction equations with more accurate regression parameters were proposed for the Sudanese population. ",,,"Ali, M. A.

The endosulfan-dosed group had significantly lower dressing-out percentage and both groups had significant depletions of omental and mesenteric fats. Significant reductions were also seen on body and cavity fats, the latter being severely reduced suggesting more mobilization of cavity fat than body fat.

JOUR ,,,,,"This study was carried out in southern Darfur, Sudan during dry-and green (wet) season and was designed to investigate the effects of season (dry-versus green season) on the blood constituents of the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius). Two hundred and ten blood samples collected from apparently healthy one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) of different age and sex groups were used in this study, out of which 110 blood samples were collected during the dry season, while 100 blood samples were collected during the green season. The data analysis revealed that the season had significant effects on some of the haematological indices and the blood metabolites and minerals concentrations. The red blood cells count, lymphocytes and basophils percentages increased significantly during the dry season, while the osmotic resistance, MCV, MCH and neutrophils percentage increased significantly during the green season. The serum levels of total protein, globulins and triglycerides increased significantly during the dry season, while the concentrations of plasma glucose and serum urea, creatinine, phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca) increased significantly during the green season. The results obtained in the present study indicate that the nutritional status could induce significant changes in the physiological responses of the dromedary camel. The available forage during the green season improved the body condition, the blood metabolic and mineral profile in camels. The results indicate that despite camel's selectivity and unique adaptation to arid conditions; glucose, urea, P and Ca levels were lower during the dry season. Therefore, it could be beneficial to provide concentrate feed to camels kept under dry tropical conditions. ",,,"Abdelatif, A. M.

The study has been conducted on 210 indigenous Arabian camel of different age (1-18 years) and sex and kept under natural range in southern Darfur, Sudan. The findings of the present study indicate that camels are selective browser rather than grazer. Furthermore, they are selective feeder to the parts of pasture plants they consume.

JOUR ,,,,,"Adult immunocompetent mice inoculated with Ebola (EBO) or Marburg (MBG) virus do not become ill. A suckling-mouse-passaged variant of EBO Zaire '76 ('mouse-adapted EBO-Z') causes rapidly lethal infection in adult mice after intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation, but does not cause apparent disease when inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.). A series of experiments showed that both forms of resistance to infection are mediated by the Type I interferon response. Mice lacking the cell-surface IFN-alpha/beta receptor died within a week after inoculation of EBO-Z '76, EBO Sudan, MBG Musoke or MBG Ravn, or after s.c. challenge with mouse-adapted EBO-Z. EBO Reston and EBO Ivory Coast did not cause illness, but immunized the mice against subsequent challenge with mouse-adapted EBO-Z. Normal adult mice treated with antibodies against murine IFN-alpha/beta could also be lethally infected with i.p.-inoculated EBO-Z '76 or EBO Sudan and with s.c.-inoculated mouse-adapted EBO-Z. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice became ill 3-4 weeks after inoculation with EBO-Z '76, EBO Sudan or MBG Ravn, but not the other viruses. Treatment with anti-IFN-alpha/beta antibodies markedly accelerated the course of EBO-Z '76 infection. Antibody treatment blocked the effect of a potent antiviral drug, 3-deazaneplanocin A, indicating that successful filovirus therapy may require the active participation of the Type I IFN response. Mice lacking an IFN-alpha/beta response resemble primates in their susceptibility to rapidly progressive, overwhelming filovirus infection. The outcome of filovirus transfer between animal species appears to be determined by interactions between the virus and the innate immune response.

JOUR ,,,,,"PURPOSE: VCAM-1 plays a major role in the chronic inflammatory processes present in vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. The residues 75-84 (B2702-p) and 84-75/75-84 (B2702-rp) of the major histocompatibility complex-1 (MHC-1) molecule B2702 were previously shown to bind specifically to VCAM-1. We hypothesised that radiolabelled B2702-p and B2702-rp might have potential for the molecular imaging of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in atherosclerotic plaques. METHODS: Preliminary biodistribution studies indicated that 125I-B2702-rp was unsuitable for in vivo imaging owing to extremely high lung uptake. 123I- or 99mTc-labelled B2702-p was injected intravenously to Watanabe heritable hyperlipidaemic rabbits (WHHL, n=6) and control animals (n=6). After 180 min, aortas were harvested for ex vivo autoradiographic imaging, gamma-well counting, VCAM-1 immunohistology and Sudan IV lipid staining. RESULTS: Robust VCAM-1 immunostaining was observed in Sudan IV-positive and to a lesser extent in Sudan IV-negative areas of WHHL animals, whereas no expression was detected in control animals. Significant 2.9-fold and 1.9-fold increases in 123I-B2702-p and 99mTc-B2702-p aortic-to-blood ratios, respectively, were observed between WHHL and control animals (p<0.05). Tracer uptake on ex vivo images co-localised with atherosclerotic plaques. Image quantification indicated a graded increase in 123I-B2702-p and 99mTc-B2702-p activities from control to Sudan IV-negative and to Sudan IV-positive areas, consistent with the observed pattern of VCAM-1 expression. Sudan IV-positive to control area tracer activity ratios were 17.0+/-9.0 and 5.9+/-1.8 for 123I-B2702-p and 99mTc-B2702-p, respectively.

The test gave negative results with T. b. rhodesiense from Zambia, Kenya and Uganda, virulent or Type II T. b. gambiense from Ivory Coast and T. b. brucei stocks from East and West Africa. The test was modified for colorimetric detection in dot blot format by using nested biotinylated primers in a two-step reaction.

With the spreading deserts on either side, or a very rich heritage of ancient relics, these scenic vistas are without equal elsewhere in the world. Although there are significant cultural differences among the population, Egypt has a long history of ethnic and religious compassion. Among the many rarities, main tourist attractions include the three great Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx, amazing ancient wonders of the world.

JOUR ,,,,,"Thirty-seven azo, xanthene and triphenylmethane dyes including FD and C colors currently approved for use in the U.S.A. and a number of delisted food colors, were tested in the Salmonella/microsome system. In addition to direct plate tests with five tester strains (TA1535, TA100, TA1537, TA1538, TA98), the azo dyes were also assayed after chemical reduction to their component amines.

JOUR ,,,,,"BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a chronic and destructive infection caused by either fungus or bacteria. Mycetoma has a characteristic clinical presentation of a triad of tumor-like swelling, draining sinuses, and macroscopic grains. Mycetoma infection is extremely rare in Israel; however, in view of the recent immigration from mycetoma-hyperendemic regions of Africa to Israel, physicians in Israel may encounter this infection. OBJECTIVES: To present two cases of mycetoma caused by Madurella mycatomatis in immigrants from endemic regions in Sudan treated at our hospital, and review the current literature. CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals in Israel should suspect mycetoma in patients from endemic countries who present with tumor-like swelling especially in the lower extremity. Health care workers should be able to recognize mycetoma and provide the optimal treatment before the lesion progresses to an advanced and disabling disease. ",,,"Paran, Y.

JOUR ,,,,,"Chemical-analytical studies during the past 4 years led to several new observations on the formation of tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNA) and their occurrence in smokeless tobacco, mainstream smoke (MS), and sidestream smoke (SS) of American and foreign cigarettes. When snuff was extracted by means of supercritical fluid extraction with carbon dioxide containing 10% methanol, analysis of this material confirmed that the extraction with organic solvents had been partially incomplete. Epidemiological studies in the northern Sudan showed a high risk for oral cancer for users of toombak, a home-made oral snuff. Toombak contains 100-fold higher levels of TSNA than commercial snuff in the U.S. and Sweden. The TSNA content in the saliva of toombak dippers is at least ten times higher than that reported in the saliva of dippers of commercial snuff. Biomarker studies have shown corresponding high levels of hemoglobin adducts with metabolites of NNN and NNK as well as for urinary metabolites of NNK. These data supported the epidemiological findings. The analyses of MS of U.S. and foreign cigarettes smoked under FTC conditions revealed comparable data for the smoke of nonfilter cigarettes and filter cigarettes except in the case of low- and ultralow-yield cigarettes, which showed reduced TSNA yields. The MS of cigarettes made from Burley or dark tobacco is exceptionally high in TSNA, primarily because of the high nitrate content of those tobacco types. Taking puffs of larger volume and drawing puffs more frequently, practices observed among most smokers of cigarettes with low nicotine yield, results in high TSNA values in the MS. The formation of the lung carcinogen NNK is favored during the smoldering of cigarettes, between puffs, when SS is generated. Consequently, in most samples from indoor air polluted with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), the highest concentration of an individual TSNA is that of NNK. When nonsmokers had remained for up to 2 h in a test laboratory with high ETS pollution, they excreted measurable amounts of NNK metabolites in the urine, indicative of the uptake of TSNA.

JOUR ,,,,,"Growth in length of infants in Khartoum is profoundly related to whether or not their mothers are in paid employment. Some of this relationship appears to be due to levels of infectious disease, which are much higher in the infants of working mothers. Exponential decay curves do not fit longitudinal measurements of length growth particularly well in either group of infants, but they do yield distinctive temporal patterns of residuals. Simulation demonstrates that these patterns accord with a ""catch-down"" form of growth in infants of working mothers and a ""catch-up"" form in infants of housewives. Attempts to allow for these phenomena by providing for the opportunity of a single pulse of negative sine form in the former and a similar pulse of positive sine form in the latter reduces the level of residuals and tends to reduce temporal pattern in them. Most strikingly, it leads to average growth curves for the two groups of children becoming almost identical. It is hypothesized that these decay curves represent the underlying curves of infant growth in Khartoum free from the effects of environmental variation. ",,,"Harrison, G.. A.

For both infant body weight and supine length it is shown that weaning age and illness experience are important determinants of growth. It is also shown that greater maternal income has disadvantageous effects through encouraging early weaning. Most importantly the infants of housewives have later weaning, less illness and greater weight and length at 1 year of age than the infants of mothers with jobs, showing the value of time for caring in the prevailing environmental circumstances. PIP: Path analysis was performed for infant weight and length among 96 mother-infant pairs in the study sample. The aim was to uncover causal connections between maternal income, maternal occupation, birth weight, weight at 2 months, weaning age, experience of illness from 3 to 12 months of age, and weight at 1 year. The sample was comprised of infants and mothers who were 18-30 years old, in the third trimester of pregnancy, and with 0-3 prior births. The results revealed little difference between the observed correlations and those predicted by the models. The weight model showed the expected strong positive path between birth weight and weight at 2 months and the negative path between illness experience and weight at 1 year. Late weaning appears to protect from illness and contributes to first year growth independently. Heavy infants tend to be weaned late. Heavy infants also have less illness independent of early weight gain. Infants of homemakers had higher birth weights, lower 2-month birth weights, greater 1-year birth weights, and less illness than the infants of paid working women. Homemaker status also affected weaning age. In the length model, illness affected length at 1 year, and weaning and length were not directly connected. Homemakers' infants were shorter at birth and at 2 months, but longer at 1 year than the infants of paid working women. The weight model was better at characterizing pathways and had better goodness of fit (x2 = 9.08, p 0.05). The greater health of at-home mothers in poor economic settings has important policy implications. eng ",,,"Zumrawi, FY ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jul-Aug ,,,,,,01/07/1993,12565,4,,Annals of human biology ,,,,"  Birth Weight Body Height Employment   Income , Newborn/growth & development Longitudinal Studies Models, Biological Morbidity Regression Analysis Sudan Weaning Weight Gain    Biology Child Development Correlation Studies Demographic Factors Developing Countries Economic Factors Employment Status--women Growth--determinants Health   Nutrition Northern  Nutrition Population Population Characteristics Socioeconomic Factors Socioeconomic Status Statistical Studies Studies Weaning Youth ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1993,,,,,0301-4460 (Print) 0301-4460 ,381-7 ,A path analysis of some determinants of infant growth in Khartoum ,,Ann Hum Biol ,,,A path analysis of some determinants of infant growth in Khartoum ,,,,,,,,20,,,,
